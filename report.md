# Low Issues

## L-1: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-2: Uninitialized local variables.

Initialize all the variables. If a variable is meant to be initialized to zero, explicitly set it to zero to improve code readability.

## L-3: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

</details>



## L-4: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
